# MAL-Mapping

This program retrives data from MyAnimeList. For this, a user is interested in a piece of work if its in a user's completed, plan to watch, or currently watching lists. The weight of a connection was determined by how many users were simultaneously interested in the same two anime or manga. The graphs were created by the connections found between users and were then imported to Gephi.  ![manga_graph](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24733269/121662360-3f7ae300-ca73-11eb-95f1-cd0f8cbc2517.png)
